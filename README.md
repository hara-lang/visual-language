# @hara-lang/visual-language

Hara's shared precision-material design system. It contains brand tokens,
cross-domain light/dark theme handling, responsive motifs, maximum-resolution
vector backgrounds, restrained field effects, document/product shells, and an
opt-in tool/workbench chrome for Astro and framework-free surfaces.

This package owns the **visual and semantic contract**. Product state, docking
engines, graph manipulation, drag-and-drop, command dispatch, and other
behaviour-rich editor systems remain application concerns or belong in
`@hara-lang/ui`.

**[View the published visual language laboratory](https://hara-lang.github.io/visual-language/)**

Consumers should pin a release tag exactly:

```json
"@hara-lang/visual-language": "github:hara-lang/visual-language#v1.0.0"
```

Import `theme.css`, `motifs.css`, and `theme.js` before using the existing Astro
components. Edge, Aperture, and Rack use the original restored 4096px masters
and responsive AVIF/WebP delivery assets. Rack is the material reference used by
the Hara benchmarks hero. Run `npm run assets:build` after a master changes.

The Hara material field system adds five adaptive SVG backgrounds on a
`4096 × 2304` canvas and five reusable effects. It uses frost, graphite,
brushed-metal structure, gothic vault geometry, and one functional blue signal;
there are no decorative multi-colour fields. Import it with:

```astro
---
import Backdrop from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/Backdrop.astro";
import "@hara-lang/visual-language/theme.css";
import "@hara-lang/visual-language/effects.css";
---

<section class="hero">
  <Backdrop effect="kernel" intensity="quiet" />
  <h1>Precision under load.</h1>
</section>
```

Motion is off by default. See [`HARA-IMAGERY.md`](./HARA-IMAGERY.md) for the
complete material, motion, accessibility, and composition rules.

## Experimental interface language v2

V2 has two related entry points. Both preserve the current block-H mark, signal
dot, theme storage, and heading family. Both now follow a calm-surface rule:
**precision without armour**. Common controls use quieter seams, restrained
rounding, sentence-case labels, and smooth state transitions; chamfers and
strong material effects are reserved for rare identity moments.

| Entry point | Use it for | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v2.css` | WWW, Docs, Specs, Benchmarks, World, data products, and content-heavy application shells | [`V2-THEME.md`](./V2-THEME.md) |
| `v2-tool.css` | Toolbars, docks, inspectors, palettes, viewports, timelines, consoles, and editor workbenches | [`V2-TOOL.md`](./V2-TOOL.md) |

`v2-tool.css` imports `v2.css`, so a workbench consumer imports only the tool
entry point and places both `hara-v2` and `hara-v2-tool` on its interface root.
The two layers deliberately share identity, state colours, typography, and
responsive priorities. The tool layer adds denser controls and structural
regions without making every surface visually heavier.

### Document and product shells

**[Open the five-layout v2 laboratory](https://hara-lang.github.io/visual-language/v2/)**

```astro
---
import Shell from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/Shell.astro";
import Header from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/Header.astro";
import ContextNav from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/ContextNav.astro";
import "@hara-lang/visual-language/v2.css";
---

<Shell sidebar={false}>
  <Header slot="header" section="Specs" nav={ecosystemNav} />
  <ContextNav slot="context" items={workflowNav} />
  <section class="hara-v2-panel">...</section>
</Shell>
```

The document contract is intentionally additive: v1 tokens and motifs are
unchanged, so sites can migrate layout family by layout family. See
[`V2-THEME.md`](./V2-THEME.md) for identity invariants, surface rhythm, site
anatomy, responsive behaviour, and adoption order.

### Tool, editor, and live-environment workbenches

**[Open the environment, 3D, node, and animation workbench laboratory](https://hara-lang.github.io/visual-language/v2/tool/)**

```astro
---
import WorkbenchShell from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/WorkbenchShell.astro";
import Toolbar from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/Toolbar.astro";
import ToolGroup from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/ToolGroup.astro";
import ToolButton from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/ToolButton.astro";
import DockPanel from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/DockPanel.astro";
import StatusBar from "@hara-lang/visual-language/astro/v2/tool/StatusBar.astro";
import "@hara-lang/visual-language/v2-tool.css";
---

<div class="hara-v2 hara-v2-tool">
  <WorkbenchShell label="Scene editor">
    <Toolbar slot="top" label="Scene commands" density="dense">
      <ToolGroup label="Transform">
        <ToolButton label="Move" active />
        <ToolButton label="Rotate" />
      </ToolGroup>
    </Toolbar>
    <main slot="viewport">...</main>
    <DockPanel slot="right" label="Inspector">...</DockPanel>
    <StatusBar slot="status">Ready</StatusBar>
  </WorkbenchShell>
</div>
```

The package exports twenty-one stateless Astro primitives and composites:

- controls: `Toolbar`, `ToolGroup`, `ToolButton`, `ToolToggle`, `ToolSelect`,
  `ToolNumberField`, `TabStrip`, `IconRail`, and `StatusBar`;
- structure: `WorkbenchShell`, `DockPanel`, `FloatingPalette`,
  `ViewportOverlay`, `InspectorSection`, and `PanelHeader`;
- environment: `SectionNavigator`, `EnvironmentSection`, `FrontmatterGrid`,
  `ResourceList`, `CapabilityPane`, and `EnvironmentWorkbench`.

The environment layer supplies the standard **Nav / Frontmatter / Graphics /
Code** content series and capability-aware **Sessions / Files / Canvas / 3D**
control pane. Only slots supplied by the host are rendered. See
[`V2-ENVIRONMENT.md`](./V2-ENVIRONMENT.md) for the complete composition, slot,
state, responsive, and adoption contract.

All v2 tool components provide geometry, theme, semantic roles, and initial
state markers. Applications still own event handling, focus movement,
persistence, drag/dock behaviour, command execution, provider discovery, and
domain data. See [`V2-TOOL.md`](./V2-TOOL.md) for the complete token reference,
component inventory, composition patterns, accessibility requirements, and
responsive collapse order.

The shared Open Graph system adds six `3840 × 2016` material masters and twelve
site-specific cards with deterministic typography. See
[`OG-IMAGERY.md`](./OG-IMAGERY.md) and rebuild them with `npm run assets:og`.

The theme script stores `system`, `light`, or `dark` in the `hara-theme` cookie
on `hara-lang.org` and uses local storage on local hosts.
